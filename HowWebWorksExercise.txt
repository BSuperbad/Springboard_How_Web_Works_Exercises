Part One: Solidify Terminology

In your own terms, define the following terms:

- What is HTTP?
HTTP means hypertext transfer protocol which is the type of convention or way
the browser and server talk to each other.

- What is a URL?
URL means universal resource locator which is the address for where something on the
internet resides.

- What is DNS?
Domain name system which basically holds all the IP addresses for everything on the web

- What is a query string?
A query string is a set of key-value pairs that can be passed into the URL.

- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
GET and POST. GET retrieves information from a server after a request is made. 
POST modifies information on a server after a request is made. 

- What is an HTTP request?
An HTTP request is a request from the client to a server to get some information back
in the browser.
- What is an HTTP response?
An HTTP response is the response from the server after the request has been made.
Eg. loading the webpage.

- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
An HTTP header provides extra information about the request/ response. Some examples are 
content type, Accept-language, response status codes (404), any cookies the server wants to set, 
any caching info.

- What are the processes that happen when you type 
“[http://somesite.com/some/page.html](http://somesite.com/some/page.html)” into a browser?
The browser uses DNS to take the URL and converts it into an IP address. Then the browser makes a 
request to that IP address and the server sends back a response. The browser creates a DOM from the 
HTML and any other requests separately (linked CSS, linked js, linked sources). 

Part Two: Practice Tools

1. Using ***curl***, make a ***GET*** request to the *icanhazdadjoke.com* API to find all jokes 
involving the word “pirate”
curl -H "Accept: text/plain" "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate"
What does a pirate pay for his corn? A buccaneer!
Why couldn't the kid see the pirate movie? Because it was rated arrr!
What did the pirate say on his 80th birthday? Aye Matey!
Why do pirates not know the alphabet? They always get stuck at "C".
Why are pirates called pirates? Because they arrr!   


2. Use ***dig*** to find what the IP address is for *icanhazdadjoke.com*
icanhazdadjoke.com.	262	IN	A	172.67.198.173
icanhazdadjoke.com.	262	IN	A	104.21.66.15

3. Make a simple web page and serve it using ***python3 -m http.server***. Visit the page in a browser.

Part Three: Explore Dev Tools

Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action) 
when the form is submitted.

Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.

Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.

## **Part Four: Explore the URL API**

At times, it’s useful for your JavaScript to look at the URL of the browser window and change how the script works depending on parts of that (particularly the query string).

[Read about the URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL)

Try some of the code examples in the Chrome Console so that you can get comfortable with the basic methods and properties for instances of the URL class.
