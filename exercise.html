<!-- Part Three: Explore Dev Tools

Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page 
URL for the action) 
when the form is submitted.

Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome
 Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.

Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. 
Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view 
the request and response headers, as well as the form data.

## **Part Four: Explore the URL API**

At times, itâ€™s useful for your JavaScript to look at the URL of the browser 
window and change how the script works depending on parts of that (particularly 
the query string).


Try some of the code examples in the Chrome Console so that you can get comfortable 
with the basic methods and properties for instances of the URL class. -->
